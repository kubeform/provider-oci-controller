// Apdex An Apdex configuration rule.
// The Apdex Score is computed based on how the response time of a span compares to two predefined threshold values.
// The first threshold defines the maximum response time that can still be considered satisfactory for the end user.
// The second one defines the maximum response time that can be considered tolerable. All times larger than that will
// be considered frustrating for the end user.
// An Apdex configuration rule works by selecting a subset of spans based on a filter expression and applying the
// two threshold comparisons to compute a score for each of the selected spans.
// The rule has a property "isApplyToErrorSpans" that controls whether or not to compute the Apdex for spans that have
// have been marked as errors. If this property is set to true, then error spans will have their Apdex score computed
// the same as non-error ones. If set to false, then computation for error spans will be skipped, and the score will
// be set to "frustrating" regardless of the configured thresholds. The default is "false".
// The property "isEnabled" controls whether an Apdex score is computed for the spans. Can be used to disable Apdex
// scores for certain spans. The default is "true".
// The property "priority" is used to define the importance of the rule when it's part of a rule set.
// Lower values indicate a higher priority. Rules with higher priorities will be evaluated first in the rule set. The
// priority of the rules must be unique within a rule set.
